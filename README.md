# Line_Follower_Robot_project(5 IR Sensors)
This project demonstrates a line follower robot equipped with five IR sensors for precise line tracking. The repository includes:

   The track layout used for testing (uploaded by the user),
   Details of the IR sensor placement and configuration,
   A custom algorithm implementing feedback control for accurate line following, ensuring stability and smooth navigation,
   Comprehensive documentation on hardware setup, software implementation in Arduino IDE.

This project serves as an excellent reference for robotics enthusiasts and beginners exploring sensor-based feedback control systems.
The numbers in the track are for evaluation purposes, so just ignore them...
